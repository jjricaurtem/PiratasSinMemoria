Basic Font Information
----- ---- -----------
Typographic work and development based on an old Art-DŽco public bath sign in Lyon (France). From the few letters there I drew the entire font, adding ligatures, regular and old style figures as well as a small caps version.

At the time I drew the font, I didn't knew the OpenType functions so it could be cool to add some of them. And most kernings have to be improved.

Some details are available on http://alexchavot.fr/lavoir.php
